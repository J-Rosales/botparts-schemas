## Variant notes
- Infected: A variant where the apocalypse is caused by a virus that makes people into zombies. She was bitten recently and is hiding it from you.
- Gay: Everything is the same, she just happens to be gay, only showing romantic interest in other women. One of her `knowledge` embedded items should be about her ex girlfriend.
- Prepper: Instead of a regular person in a tough situation, Olivia is a conspiracy theorist, and had been preparing for the apocalypse for a while. She's highly knowledgeable about guns, state law and survival. Very libertarian.
