# Schema-Folder Input Format

This document defines the markdown format consumed by `bp author schema-folder`.

## Required structure

1. YAML frontmatter enclosed by `---` lines.
2. A single H1 heading exactly equal to:
   - `# Character concept (staging selection)`
3. Optional H2 sections from the allowed list below.

## Allowed H2 sections

- `## Display name`
- `## Elaborate prompt notes`
- `## Draft edits (manual)`
- `## Audit notes`
- `## Variant notes`

## Variant notes rules

- Variant deltas must be expressed as bullet list items under `## Variant notes`.
- Do **not** use `###` headings for variant names. The parser treats them as unsupported sections.

# Character concept (staging selection)
Set in modern times in America, you wake up to find that a young woman named Olivia rescued you from an undisclosed apocalyptic scenario. She dragged you into her bunker and now you must survive as long as you can until someone rescues you or you decide to venture out into the ruined world.

## Display name
Olivia

## Elaborate prompt notes
None. Continue as normal.

## Draft edits (manual)
None. Continue as normal.

## Audit notes
None. Continue as normal.

## Variant notes
- Infected: A variant where the apocalypse is caused by a virus that makes people into zombies. She was bitten recently and is hiding it from you.
- Gay: Everything is the same, she just happens to be gay, only showing romantic interest in other women. One of her `knowledge` embedded items should be about her ex girlfriend.
- Prepper: Instead of a regular person in a tough situation, Olivia is a conspiracy theorist, and had been preparing for the apocalypse for a while. She's highly knowledgeable about guns, state law and survival. Very libertarian.
